# The Art of Naming in Programming

Ever heard of the saying; "There are only two hard things in programming: cache invalidation and naming things"? In this article I'll share some tips on how to improve your naming skills and make your code more readable. I'll be doing this not only for you but also for myself because it's a problem I still struggle with.

To start of, when you're coding, it's important to completely understand the problem you're trying to solve. Sometimes we get so caught up in our work that we forget how other people see the problem. So, to begin with, try to encounter the problem from different angles, and make sure you can explain it in a way that even your grandma would understand (well, maybe not exactly, but you get the idea).

One cool concept I stumbled upon is called the "ubiquitous language." It's all about using a common vocabulary between developers and stakeholders. Instead of assuming everyone knows what we mean by certain terms, we should align our language to avoid misunderstandings. For example, if we say "user," it might mean something different to non-dev folks. So, let's be clear and specify if we mean a customer, a company, or something else.

Empathy is key here too. Think about the poor souls (including your future self) who will have to work with your code down the line. Using clear and explicit names will make their lives so much easier. Trust me, you don't want them cursing your coding skills in the middle of the night.

Now, let's talk about naming things directly in your code. Clarity and conciseness should be your best friends. No more arbitrary names or confusing abbreviations! Descriptive names that leave no room for interpretation are the way to go. And remember, keeping functions and methods small helps a lot. When they have a single responsibility, you can give them focused and accurate names that describe exactly what they do.

Oh, and a little tip: if you find yourself adding a ton of comments to explain why something is named the way it is, that's a sign that your naming skills might need a little TLC. Code should be self-explanatory, so rely on clear names rather than excessive comments. Nobody likes playing the game of matching comments with code and getting lost in the process.

Programming is not just about problem-solving; it's like a form of writing that others will read. So, take the time to master your naming conventions. Practice makes perfect, my friend. By following these guidelines, you'll improve the quality of your code and make it more readable for yourself and others.

Happy coding and happy naming!
