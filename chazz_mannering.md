Chazz Mannering, a 26-year-old student with a passion for drumming, gaming, anime, and code, embarked on an exciting internship journey at C°F, a renowned Data-driven Design & Technology Consultancy. This internship opportunity was part of Chazz's Minor Web Development and Design program, and it proved to be an invaluable experience in his professional growth.

Before joining C°F, Chazz completed his pre-university education (HAVO) and pursued a 1-year course in ICT. His curiosity and enthusiasm for technology led him to enroll in CMD (Communication and Multimedia Design). Starting his CMD journey in 2017, Chazz successfully completed all the available tech tracks while simultaneously working as a Frontend Developer, showcasing his dedication and commitment to expanding his skill set.

C°F, true to its name, focuses on unraveling the complexities of the world through data, design, and technology. Chazz had the privilege to contribute to the creation of a Corona Dashboard during his internship, gaining hands-on experience in data visualization and data-driven experiences. This opportunity allowed him to witness the power of combining data insights with intuitive design, ultimately creating meaningful and impactful solutions.

Within C°F's vibrant and multidisciplinary team, comprising 40 professionals with diverse backgrounds, Chazz collaborated with data analysts, frontend developers, designers, and UX specialists. The team fostered a collaborative environment through weekly team meetings and tech/design reviews, promoting knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.

From a technical standpoint, C°F's tech stack revolved primarily around React and Next for frontend development. Chazz had the opportunity to delve into these technologies, enhancing his proficiency and understanding of modern web development practices. The exposure to such industry-standard tools was an invaluable asset that he could carry forward in his career.

During his time at C°F, Chazz worked on an array of intriguing projects that showcased his versatility and adaptability. These projects included the prototype day gallery, artmile AR, Globalance, Experiments page, Powers of Ten, and Patterns of Cairo. The prototype day, an annual internal project resembling a hackathon, offered Chazz the chance to demonstrate his problem-solving skills and work on a challenging task within a limited timeframe.

One aspect that particularly intrigued Chazz was the exploration of Augmented Reality (AR) on the web. He conducted extensive testing, exploring both Web AR and React Native AR, to determine the most suitable approach. Ultimately, due to accessibility reasons, Chazz favored React Native AR over Unity, recognizing the importance of making technology inclusive and user-friendly.

Throughout his internship journey, Chazz gained valuable insights and offers some tips for fellow interns. Firstly, he emphasizes the importance of self-awareness. Knowing oneself, including strengths, weaknesses, and areas of interest, allows interns to make the most of their experiences. Secondly, Chazz encourages interns to stay open-minded and embrace new technologies, as the field of web development is constantly evolving. Engaging in discussions with colleagues about design and technology is another valuable piece of advice, recognizing the mutual learning opportunities that arise from such interactions. Lastly, Chazz encourages interns to share their interesting projects or ideas with colleagues, fostering collaboration and sparking creativity within the team.

While Chazz's internship at C°F provided him with invaluable experiences, he also considered other potential companies for internships. In his search, Chazz looked for companies that avoided mundane page-building WordPress practices, targeted medium to large-sized organizations, and offered exciting projects. Some of the companies he explored included Voorhoede, Dept, Mirabeau, Grrr, and BuildIn Amsterdam.

Chazz Mannering's internship at C°F served as a stepping stone in his professional journey, providing him with real-world exposure and equipping him with practical skills.
