## Introduction:

Immersive environments on the web provide a unique and engaging way to connect with users, especially in situations where physical access to museums and organizations is limited. This documentation outlines the key concepts and technologies used in the development of immersive environments, specifically focusing on a project undertaken as part of Brian Bawuah's CMD graduation project. The project aimed to address the challenge of maintaining a connection with the target audience during the lockdown period. It leveraged immersive environments and social virtual reality (VR) to create an interactive and engaging experience for users.

## Lockdown Challenges:

During the lockdown, many museums and organizations faced the issue of limited access for their target audience. To overcome this challenge, the project focused on developing an immersive environment that allowed users to listen to artists and engage with the content virtually. Additionally, the project capitalized on the growing popularity of social VR to enhance user interaction and participation.

## Stedelijk Museum Integration:

As part of the project, the Stedelijk Museum was integrated into the immersive environment. The following features were implemented:

1. Virtual Reality (VR): Users were able to experience the immersive environment using VR technology, creating a more realistic and immersive experience.

2. Character Creation: Users had the ability to create their own virtual characters within the environment, allowing for personalization and customization.

3. Group Calls: Communication among users was facilitated through group calls, enabling real-time interaction and collaboration within the immersive environment.

## Prototyping Immersive Environment:

The development of the immersive environment involved several steps and technologies. The key stages are as follows:

1. Functional and Technical Requirements: The project began by defining the functional and technical requirements of the immersive environment. This included identifying the desired features, user interactions, and technical capabilities.

2. Sketching and Brown Boxing: The initial concepts and layout of the environment were sketched and refined. Brown boxing techniques were used to create low-fidelity prototypes, enabling quick iterations and adjustments.

3. Blender and Unity: The 3D modeling and animation software Blender, along with the game development platform Unity, were utilized to create and design the virtual environment. These tools allowed for the creation of realistic and visually appealing assets.

4. 3D Character Development: The project employed the "Ready Player Me" platform to generate 3D characters for users, adding a personal touch to their virtual experience.

5. Animation of 3D Characters: Mixamo, a web-based platform for character animation, was utilized to animate the 3D characters within the environment. This added movement and interactivity to the immersive experience.

## Technologies Used:

The following technologies were used in the final implementation of the immersive environment:

1. HTML Canvas: HTML canvas element was employed to render the graphical elements and provide a visual representation of the immersive environment.

2. WebGL: WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics, was utilized to enhance the visual quality and performance of the immersive environment.

3. ThreeJS: ThreeJS, a JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D computer graphics in a web browser, was employed to facilitate the rendering and manipulation of 3D objects within the environment.

4. WebXR: WebXR API was utilized to enable the connection with VR headsets, allowing users to experience the immersive environment in virtual reality.

5. NextJS: NextJS, a React framework, was used to build the immersive environment, providing server-side rendering capabilities and simplifying the development process.

6. Web Sockets: Web Sockets were employed to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between the immersive environment and other computers, enabling features like chat and multiplayer interactions.

7. Web RTC: Web RTC was utilized as a means of establishing connections between different computers, similar to platforms such as Zoom and Google Meets. This technology facilitated real-time communication and collaboration within the immersive environment.
