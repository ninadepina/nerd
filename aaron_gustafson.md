# Making Websites Work for Everyone: A Comprehensive Guide by Aaron Gustafson

In the fast-paced world of web development, it's crucial to ensure that websites are accessible and inclusive for all users. Aaron Gustafson, the Principal Accessibility Innovation Strategist at Microsoft, has dedicated his career to championing accessibility on the web. In this article, we will explore his insights on making websites work for everyone and the principles of progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.

When developing websites, it's essential to consider the diverse range of user networks and conditions that exist. This includes varying internet connections such as wifi, hardline, and mobile networks. The web experience is far from homogenous, as different devices and connections can affect performance and functionality. To address this, developers must take these factors into account when designing and building websites.

One effective practice for ensuring website accessibility is through the use of progressive enhancement or graceful degradation. This approach involves starting with the most basic functionality and then building upon it. By developing this way, developers ensure that the core functionality of the website will work for anyone, regardless of their device or network connection. Additional features and enhancements can then be added for users with more advanced devices or connections.

A common metaphor used to explain progressive enhancement is the escalator. Just like an escalator always works, even if it's not moving, a well-designed website should function even if certain elements, such as JavaScript, are not enabled. While the website may not offer the same level of interactivity or advanced features without JavaScript, it should still provide a functional experience for all users.

Gustafson emphasizes several key steps to consider when developing websites for accessibility and inclusivity:

1. Focus on what matters: Prioritize the most important elements of your website and focus on those first. This helps reduce unnecessary complexity and ensures that the core purpose of the website is fulfilled.

2. Write it out, then read it back: Before diving into coding, take the time to plan out your website and write down your ideas. Read through your plan to ensure everything makes sense and that you haven't overlooked any crucial aspects or overcomplicated things.

3. Use semantic code: Employ HTML tags that accurately describe the content they contain. Semantic code makes it easier for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies, to understand and use your website.

4. Use design to communicate intent: Good design goes beyond aesthetics; it should effectively communicate the purpose and message of your website to visitors. Utilize common design patterns and ensure that your design conveys your intent clearly.

5. Consider design choices and their impact on user experience: Design choices such as layout, color selection, and typography can have a significant impact on how users interact with your site. Think about how these elements can affect usability and accessibility, and make informed decisions.

6. Think about different user interactions: People access websites using various devices and browsers, with different network speeds and conditions. Ensure your site is responsive and accessible across different platforms, accommodating diverse ways users might interact with your site.

7. Iterate: Website development is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to refine and improve your site as you go, incorporating user feedback and staying up-to-date with evolving accessibility guidelines and technologies.

Gustafson's presentation, "Adapting to Reality," emphasizes the ever-changing landscape of web development and the challenges it presents. He highlights the historical progression of screen sizes and the need to adapt website designs accordingly. From the early days of small screens with fixed-width websites to the rise of smartphones with varying screen sizes and orientations, web developers have had to constantly adjust their approach.

The presentation also emphasizes the importance of considering different ways people might interact with websites. This includes eye tracking, touch, keyboard, mouse, pen, braille, and audio interactions, among others.
