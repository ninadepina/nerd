# Exploring the World of 3D on the Web with Three.js by Servin Nissen

## Introduction

As part of the Minor Web Development and Design, we recently had the opportunity to learn about 3D on the web from Servin, a lead frontend developer at Level 30 Wizards, a creative digital studio. Servin shared his insights and expertise on the topic, focusing on the popular framework Three.js. In this article, we will delve into the key concepts and technologies discussed during his presentation, providing a comprehensive overview of 3D on the web.

## Canvas and WebGL

To create 3D scenes on the web, developers often utilize the HTML `<canvas>` element. This versatile element allows for drawing and animating graphics using the canvas scripting API or the powerful WebGL API. WebGL, a JavaScript API built on top of OpenGL, enables developers to render interactive 2D and 3D graphics directly within web browsers. It harnesses the power of the graphics card (GPU) to deliver high-performance graphics and visual effects.

## Shaders and PixiJS

When working with WebGL, developers need to write shaders, which are small programs that define how vertices and fragments are processed. Shaders are written in a specialized mathematical language and can be complex. However, various tools are available to simplify the process. In addition to WebGL, Servin introduced PixiJS, an intriguing API that facilitates the creation of captivating 2D animations using WebGL.

## Fundamentals of Three.js

Three.js is a powerful framework built on top of WebGL, making it more accessible and user-friendly for developers. Servin outlined some of the fundamental concepts of Three.js, which are crucial for working with 3D scenes.

-   Axis and Vector3: In 3D, an additional axis, the Z-axis, is introduced alongside the familiar X and Y axes. Understanding how to manipulate and utilize these axes is essential for creating 3D graphics.

-   Cameras: Three.js provides different camera types, such as perspective and orthographic cameras. These cameras determine the view and perspective of the 3D scene.

-   Lighting: Lighting plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal of 3D scenes. Servin discussed various light sources, including ambient light, directional light, point light, and spotlights, each offering unique effects and illumination.

-   Meshes and Renderers: Three.js introduces the concept of meshes, which combine geometries (such as boxes) and materials to represent objects within the 3D scene. Renderers are responsible for rendering the scene and camera views onto the canvas element.

## Future Possibilities

Servin briefly touched upon the future possibilities in 3D on the web. Two emerging technologies that hold great promise are WebGPU and WebXR. WebGPU, the successor to WebGL, is a new API that aims to offer improved performance and better utilization of the GPU. WebXR, on the other hand, enables the creation of websites for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices, ushering in a new era of immersive web experiences.

## Resources for Further Exploration

To conclude the lecture, Servin shared several valuable resources for those interested in delving deeper into the world of 3D on the web:

-   THREEJS-JOURNEY: A comprehensive paid course designed for beginners to learn Three.js.
-   SIMONDEV: A YouTube channel with advanced tutorials and demonstrations related to Three.js.
-   The Book of Shaders: A resource dedicated to learning about shaders, with a focus on fragment shaders.
-   Three.js Examples: A vast collection of open-source examples showcasing the capabilities of Three.js.
-   Additional Resources: Servin also mentioned Maxbox.io, Kodeclubs.com, and Bruno-Simon as valuable sources of information and inspiration.

## Conclusion

Servin's presentation on 3D on the web and Three.js provided a valuable insight into the world of creating immersive and interactive experiences. By utilizing the power of WebGL and frameworks like Three.js, developers can bring their 3D visions to life on the web. As technologies such as WebGPU and WebXR continue to evolve, the future of 3D on the web holds even greater potential for captivating and engaging user experiences.
