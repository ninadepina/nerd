# Accessible, Creative Development: Enhancing Website Accessibility for All Users by Cyd Stumpel

Website accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development that ensures inclusivity for all users, regardless of their abilities. However, despite the significance of accessibility, numerous award-winning websites still fall short in this regard. In a recent lecture by Cyd Stumpel, a creative freelance developer, the importance of website accessibility was discussed, along with practical strategies for creating accessible websites. Common mistakes made by developers and designers were also highlighted, shedding light on how to avoid them.

One of the primary mistakes that contribute to website inaccessibility is hiding focus states. When focus states are concealed, users may find it challenging to navigate through a website using assistive technologies or keyboard-only interactions. Similarly, the excessive use of moving text can create difficulties for users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities, leading to a less optimal user experience. Another prevalent error is poorly formatted HTML, which can hinder the proper interpretation of content by screen readers and other assistive technologies. Additionally, neglecting to respect prefers-reduced-motion and similar media queries can negatively impact users who prefer or require reduced motion on websites.

A common practice among "creative" websites is replacing the native scroll functionality with a smooth scroll library to achieve a more stylistic experience. However, such scroll libraries often disrupt the native functionality of the browser, making it harder for users to interact with the website. For instance, the native "find" function (ctrl / cmd + f) in most browsers allows users to search for specific words on a page. Yet, disabling native scroll can prevent the browser from automatically scrolling to the keyword, hindering users from quickly finding relevant information. An alternative to these common scrolling libraries is Lenis, a scrolling library that provides more control over the scrolling experience while preserving most of the functionality offered by native scroll.

To address these accessibility issues, developers must reassess their defaults and rethink their design decisions. By considering and preserving the native functionality of the browser, developers can create websites that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. A key principle is to avoid interfering with the fundamental features provided by the browser, such as focus states and native scrolling, which are essential for users relying on assistive technologies or different interaction methods.

During the lecture, Cyd Stumpel shared her insights into why many award-winning websites continue to be inaccessible. One reason is that many developers are self-taught and may not be aware of accessibility guidelines and best practices. However, she also emphasized that the grading system used by award juries plays a role in evaluating websites, with accessibility often accounting for only a fraction of the overall score. Nonetheless, it is essential to prioritize accessibility to ensure a truly inclusive web experience.

Cyd Stumpel provided valuable tips for developers aiming to enhance website accessibility. Firstly, developers should reconsider their defaults, resets, and commonly used code snippets to ensure they align with accessibility standards. Adding text alternatives to letter, word, or line animations can make the content accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies. Additionally, developers should take into account the native functionality of virtual scrolling libraries, making sure they do not compromise essential browser features. Finally, respecting user settings, such as animation preferences or the prefers-reduced-motion media query, allows for a personalized and inclusive browsing experience.

Cyd Stumpel's experience as a freelance creative developer and her work with renowned platforms such as Awwwards and FDND (Frontend Design & Development) provided valuable insights into the importance of accessibility and creative web development. By following her recommendations and staying updated with tools like GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and industry resources like Awwwards, developers can strive towards creating accessible websites while maintaining their creative vision.

In conclusion, accessible, creative development is crucial for ensuring that websites are inclusive and usable by everyone. By avoiding common accessibility mistakes, considering native browser functionality, and prioritizing accessibility in the development process, developers can create websites that provide a seamless experience for users of all abilities. Through Cyd Stumpel's lecture, the significance of website accessibility was emphasized, empowering developers to make conscious choices and contribute to a more inclusive digital landscape.
